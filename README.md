# Scratch-to-reveal-animation
Just descovered a cool libary that is called p5.js and created an animation where you have to "scratch" your screen with the left mouse button pressed in order to see content
I'm pretty sure that someone has already created something like this and posted somewhere on the Internet, so, most likely, this idea is not mine)
